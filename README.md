# Russian_Roulette_IRC
Russian Roulette IRC Bot

Description:


Russian roulette IRC bot, it offers people a shot of vodka when they join, and plays russian roulette
with them. Instead of a gunshot, it kicks the player. If someone speaks on the 0 or 30 second mark russian-bot will check the time, announce it to the channel, and take a swig of vodka.

Usage:


BrofessionalBrogrammer: .roulette

russian-bot: 'click'

BrofessionalBrogrammer: .roulette

*russian-bot has kicked BrofessionalBrogrammer from #channel (BANG!)

Configuration:


Edit the RussianBot.py file, change the default values for server, channel, the bots nickname, password, and optionally, the channel password. This bot has to at least be half-op'd for people to play, as it kicks people if they lose (with a BANG!).
